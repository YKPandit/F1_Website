# F1_Website
Training a model in python to predict who will win the next formula 1 and providing a visual interface to see data about a driver

# Goal
This is where I will train the prediction model, I will use the lap data to figure out who will have the fastest lap, then create a second model for predicting race wins

I will create this as an api I can use in other projects
